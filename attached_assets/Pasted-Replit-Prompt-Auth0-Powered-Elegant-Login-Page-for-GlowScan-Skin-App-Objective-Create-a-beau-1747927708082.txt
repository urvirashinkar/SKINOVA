Replit Prompt: "Auth0-Powered Elegant Login Page for GlowScan Skin App"

🎯 Objective:
Create a beautifully designed login page for the GlowScan AI Skincare App, powered by Auth0 for secure real-user authentication. The login should support Google, Apple, and other providers, and redirect to the main landing page after successful login.
The UI should feel slightly darker, maintaining the soft, luxurious aesthetic of a high-end dermatology product or spa brand.
💻 Tech Stack:
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
Auth: Auth0 (real-world login integration)
Routing: React Router
Hosting Environment: Replit
🎨 UI & Styling Guidelines (Dark Luxe Skin Theme):
Background: Soft dark ivory or warm taupe tone (#F8F8F2 → darkened by ~10%)
Primary Accent: Olive Gold (#C5C27E)
Secondary Accent: Deep Olive (#8D8A5A)
Text: Use slightly muted dark gray (#2C2C2C) for natural softness
Button Hover Effects: Smooth, with subtle glow or emboss shadows
Font: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Poppins, Inter, or DM Sans)
Box Shadows: Gentle, ambient glow
Border Radius: Use rounded-2xl for modern pill-shaped elements
Button Styles:
Google/Apple login buttons should follow Auth0 defaults with customized button containers
Auth buttons should feel like luxury product labels — clean, subtle, minimal
🔐 Auth0 Integration Flow:
Register an Auth0 application (if not done already)
Enable Google, Apple, and optionally Email/Password login in Auth0 settings
Use Auth0Provider to wrap the app and manage routing
After successful login, redirect to /home or /landing
Use useAuth0() to access isAuthenticated, loginWithRedirect(), etc.
